    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This paper explores a formal approach to modelling recursive cognitive
      processes within the human telencephalon. Rather than focusing on semantic
      interpretation or phenomenological description, the proposed framework
      emphasizes structural recurrence, iterative constraints, and minimal
      representational units.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Contemporary models of cognition frequently privilege meaning, intention,
      and representation. However, recent developments in computational
      neuroscience suggest that higher-order cognitive functions may emerge
      from simpler recursive structures that precede semantic attribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telencephalon, as the primary locus of higher cognitive integration,
      provides a compelling substrate for examining such recursive patterns.
      This work proposes that structure itself may be the primary carrier of
      cognitive coherence.
    </p>

    <h2>Methodological Framework</h2>
    <p>
      The methodology adopted in this study deliberately avoids interpretive
      semantics. Instead, it relies on formal constraints, repetition, and
      invariant structural relationships. These relationships are expressed
      through discrete units that can be enumerated, ordered, and recombined
      without reference to linguistic meaning.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      Preliminary analysis indicates that recursive stability is preserved
      even when semantic content is removed entirely. This supports the
      hypothesis that structure, rather than meaning, constitutes the primary
      organizing principle of complex cognition.

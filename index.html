<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The human telencephalon represents the most structurally and functionally complex
region of the mammalian brain, serving as the primary substrate for higher-order
cognitive processes. This manuscript proposes a recursive abstraction model
intended to describe hierarchical information processing within telencephalic
structures. The model attempts to bridge anatomical organization and symbolic
representation, suggesting that cognition emerges from iterative self-referential
loops rather than linear signal propagation.
</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Contemporary models of cognition frequently rely on modular or network-based
approaches to explain the functional organization of the brain. While such models
have proven useful, they often fail to account for the apparent continuity between
perception, abstraction, and symbolic reasoning observed in human cognition.
The telencephalon, encompassing the cerebral cortex and associated subcortical
structures, provides a suitable domain for investigating these limitations.
</p>

<p>
Previous work has emphasized localized specialization within the telencephalon;
however, emerging evidence suggests that cognitive phenomena may arise from
recursive interactions across multiple hierarchical levels. This work seeks to
formalize such interactions into a conceptual and mathematical framework.
</p>

<h2>2. Theoretical Framework</h2>
<p>
The proposed model treats telencephalic processing as a series of recursive
transformations applied to representational states. Each transformation layer
operates on the output of the previous layer, while simultaneously influencing
its own input through feedback mechanisms. This recursive structure is hypothesized
to enable abstraction, self-reference, and symbolic manipulation.
</p>

<p>
Rather than assigning discrete cognitive functions to isolated regions, the model
emphasizes patterns of recurrence and convergence. In this view, meaning is not
encoded at a single locus, but emerges through repeated iteration across scales.
</p>

<h2>3. Implications for Cognitive Modelling</h2>
<p>
If cognition is indeed grounded in recursive telencephalic processes, then
algorithmic descriptions of intelligence may be better understood as rediscoveries
of biological principles rather than artificial constructs. Such a perspective
challenges prevailing distinctions between natural and artificial cognition,
suggesting a deeper structural correspondence.
</p>

<p>
These implications extend beyond neuroscience into fields such as artificial
intelligence, philosophy of mind, and formal logic. However, rigorous empirical
validation remains necessary.
</p>

<h2>4. Limitations and Withdrawal</h2>
<p>
The present manuscript was withdrawn prior to formal peer review following
methodological disputes concerning the empirical tractability of the proposed
framework. Specifically, concerns were raised regarding the operational definition
of recursion within biological substrates and the lack of direct experimental
validation.
</p>

<p>
Despite these limitations, the author maintains that the conceptual model warrants
further consideration as a heuristic for understanding higher-order cognition.
